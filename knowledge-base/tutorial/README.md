# Tutorials

> A tutorial is an experience that takes place under the guidance of a tutor.

Tutorials are **learning**-oriented.

## Key principles:

- Show the learner where they’ll be going
- Deliver visible results early and often
- Maintain a narrative of the expected
- Point out what the learner should notice
- Target the feeling of doing
- Encourage and permit repetition
- Ruthlessly minimise explanation
- … and focus on the concrete
- Ignore options and alternatives
- Aspire to perfect reliability
